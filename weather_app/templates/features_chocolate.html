        <P style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 25px;">Chocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. 
        Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.</P>

            <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;"> Dark chocolate contains powerful antioxidants. Among the most beneficial is a flavonol called epicatechin.
            Flavonols are compounds found in plants that fight inflammation and protect against cell damage caused by free radicals.</p>
                
                <h style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">Health Benefits.</h>

                    
            <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">Spinach is a great staple to add to your diet. This leafy green vegetable grows all year round and is packed with vitamins and minerals.  
            There are two basic types of spinach: flat-leaf and savoy. When you buy fresh, bunched spinach at the grocery store, it is usually savoy spinach. The leaves of savoy spinach are typically wrinkled and curly. 
                    Flat spinach, also known as baby spinach, is widely popular in the U.S. and is often sold bagged, canned, or frozen. </p>
                        
        <h style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">Health Benefits.</h>
        
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">These are just a few of the ways research has shown that dark chocolate can benefit you:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
                        
        <h style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">Increases heart health.</h>
        
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">The antioxidants in dark chocolate have been shown to lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of clotting and increase blood circulation to the heart, thus lowering the risks of stroke,
            coronary heart disease and death from heart disease.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
                        
        <h style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">Balances the immune system.</h>
        
                <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">Flavonols prevent the immune system from going into overdrive and reduce oxidative stress, which is an imbalance caused by cells fighting against free radicals and a common cause of many diseases.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
        <h style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">Combats diabetes</h>
        
                <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">Epicatechin protects cells, makes them stronger and supports the processes that help the body to use insulin better, which might prevent or combat diabetes.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
        <h style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">Improves brain function.</h>
        
                <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 22px;">Flavonols in dark chocolate have a positive impact on brain function, including better reaction time, visual-spatial awareness and stronger memory. Though research is ongoing, one reason for this may be that flavonols increase blood flow to the brain.</p>
